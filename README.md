# VirtoolsUnpacker
Virtools files unpacker, rewritten in C#

# Usage
- Compile via Visual Studio 2022 or by using 
```csharp
dotnet build
```
- Drag the Virtools-compiled file into the VirtoolsUnpacker.exe, or run it in CMD and specify path to the file in the arguments.
- Can also do `-l` argument to list all the files inside the Virtools packed file.

## The project is originally written by [Luigi Auriemma](aluigi.altervista.org), and all the copyrights belong to them. I only rewrote it in C# so it will be easier for me to learn Syberia reverse engineering.
